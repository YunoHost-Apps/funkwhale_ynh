## Overview
A modern, convivial and free music server on YunoHost

Installation requires a dedicated domain or subdomain. Installing in a subpath is not supported by the upstream project due to dependency requirements.

**Shipped version:** 1.1

## Demo

* [Official demo](https://demo.funkwhale.audio)

**Username:** demo **Password:** demo

## Admin

The admin uses the login you provided at installation. The password is the same you use for YunoHost.
The admin interface is accessible at the address: `your.domain.fr/api/admin`

To add a collection of music files to a library in your YunoHost installation of Funkwhale, create a symlink to your collection titled "import" in `/var/www/funkwhale`
```console
foo@bar:~$sudo ln -s /your/music/collection /var/www/funkwhale/import
```
The files can then be added to your library from the *uploading* tab in a music library under the heading **Import music from your server**.
