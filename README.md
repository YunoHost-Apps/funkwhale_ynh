# Funkwhale
A modern, convivial and free music server on YunoHost

[![Install Funkwhale with YunoHost](https://install-app.yunohost.org/install-with-yunohost.png)](https://install-app.yunohost.org/?app=funkwhale)

Installation requires a dedicated domain for now. I hope subpath installation will be possible in the future.

**Shipped version:** 0.17.0 (this is an Alpha version!)

## Admin

Admin password is **funkwhale**, login is the user you provided at installation.

The admin interface is accessible with the address: your.domain.fr/api/admin
